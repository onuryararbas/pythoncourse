#first, define your variables
x=10
y=40

if x < y:
    print (x, "is less than",y)
else:
    print(x,"is greater than",y)
'''
this saying that if x is less than y, say it, if x is greater than y, then say it.
TIP: YOU CAN USE ELSE IF YOU DONT WANT TO WRITE IF X>Y MULTIPLE TIMES EVERYTIME YOU MAKE A EXCEPTION
'''
