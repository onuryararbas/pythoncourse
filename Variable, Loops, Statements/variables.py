variable1 = 200

print (variable1)

#can also add strings

variable2 = 200

print (variable2)

#can elaborate on previous variables

variable3 = variable2 * 2
print (variable3)
'''
this prints saying variable3 is variable2 times 2
be careful to never have someting multiplied by a string, aka variable5 = "200" and then say variable 6 is variable5
times 2, then the result is just 200200, so avoid that
