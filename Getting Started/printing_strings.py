#print helps you type something out onto interface

print ("hello world")

#if you want to add a word onto a already existing word

print ("hello","world")

#if you want to write something with a apostrophe, like I'm, dont just immediatly say print ("I'm") 
#because then it just print prints I. Instead, do the following.

print ("I\'m 13") 

#end result is I'm 13 on the terminal

#if you want to quote make sure that the apostrophes that start the print are singular, rather than multiple so you can do
#print ('he said "hi"') for the result to be He said "hi"
